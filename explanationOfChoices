gradient scale is based on 64 steps because of the fact that RGB colors are 0-255 for each channel and this is a suitable slice of the possible color spectrum

internal preference for drop down option menus

the peptides are only colored see through rectangles so they would not impede or alter the visual interpretation of the protein representation

filter in the protein comparison window works as a regex filter for more advanced filtering

accession masking is used to make sure you can find data about hybrid proteins that are not available in common data sources

when using a pdb file to display secondary features, the standard pdb that is used, is the one with the highest resolution, displaying others can be done by selecting another one from a combobox

the handling of accession masking, fetching, and filtering, is done in that particular order when not specifying your own order when loading in your data.
extra dataretrieval steps can be added by putting the class reference in the dataretrievalpreference file and putting the class on the classpath of the program

does not handle protein inference, expects this to be done by an outside agent or on the dataset beforehand

a peptidegroup is a grouping of peptides on a protein where the largest in the group contains all the smaller ones in his start to end location.
Peptides are also grouped when being of the same length. The smallest peptide in the group is always represented visually.
This approach breaks down when using multiple proteases, and as such, are not supported.

CPDT is a C++ program compiled in visual studio and therefor needs the redistributable of that version. it is added in the resources folder but there is no first time prompt as of yet
